        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Items in brackets are tags, the tags and content between make up an element.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements are important for increasing the frequency of your page showing in a search, as well as making the code and page easier to review and traverse</li>
          <li>Headers range from h1 to h6 and determine the size of the text placed there, the h1 header should only be used once in a page</li>
          <li>HTML is the foundation of our webpage where we add the content before giving it style with CSS and functionality with JS</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>A color code can be done using a semantic term such as gray or blue, or using a specific color code.</li>
          <li>The selector, placed before declarations determines what elements the terms will be applied to.</li>
          <li>The declartions determine the styling used and the value of that style. i.e. {color: blue} means the styling used is color and the value is blue</li>
          <li>An external style sheet is a sheet used to store CSS seperately from the HTML, it must be linked via a link in the HTML's head element</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: pulls the code from the main branch to your local desktop.</li>
          <li>git push origin "branch name" pushes code from local desktop to remote code(github). </li>
          <li>git add -A adds modifications we made on the current branch to the staging area. The -A means we are adding all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message" commits our code and -m allows us to add a message to describe what we are committing.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An array needs to be used to define the variables before any function can use them.</li>
          <li>/*your message here*/ can be used to make code inactive or store a message that the computer will ignore, alternativelly // can be used if it fits on one line.</li>
          <li>You must call a function by typing out the function name followed by () before it will activate in the console.</li>
          <li>Array items or indiced items are numbered starting at 0 and going up one whole number each time.</li>
          <li>The console.log command shows the code what message to show in the console when the conditions are met.</li>
          <li>A string must always be encased in single quotes while a number or boolean statement(true/false) do not go in quotes.</li>
          <li>An if loop will continue to run until a truthy statement is found and executed at which point the code will go back to the control flow state.</li>
